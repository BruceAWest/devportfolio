                        My name is Bruce! But it's not really. My real name is Brandan – but call me Bruce. Now that we have that out of the way: I'm a veteran Army combat medic turned corporate manager, turned Computer Information Systems major who is currently in school. In my free time I manage IT and web development for a few veterans organizations that I love. I started with Wordpress, which is what brought me out of my corporate career to study the craft of developing software. Currently I'm venturing into the worlds of Node.JS, Java and C#. I'm also in the infancy of honing my full-stack engineering skills. Presently I'm a front-end engineer with full-stack tendancies.

                    At Holiday I specialized in Independant Living Retirement communty management - which is basically a combination of property management, sales, and social engineering. I especially excelled at sales, so I transferred to a Community Sales Leader role, and upon resigning from the industry to pursue my venture into IT my community occupancy rate was at 100%, a huge accomplishment in that industry.

                        <p>
                          SRQ Vets is a locally based 501(c)(3) non-profit founded and led by volunteer veterans serving veterans in the SRQ area. We offer a broad range of assistance to local vets in need, including helping in the Veterans Court, the Veterans Filmmaking Academy, Operation Rubix, aiding veterans in need of transportation, home modifications for disabled vets, and much more. Our scope is broad, but focuses entirely on local vets, helping make a local impact. We work on a 100% volunteer basis where we take resources donated or raised locally and reinvest in our local veteran community to directly help vets in need, or donate to partner local veteran organizations that will specifically use those resources to help our local veterans. We have worked hard to become a network of doers and not talkers.
